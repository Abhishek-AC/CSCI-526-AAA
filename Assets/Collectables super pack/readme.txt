Thank you for purchasing this art pack!

We have finally manage to make this pack! Every game have something to collect and its time consuming to make the low poly model, texture it properly and make an nice looking icon for the GUI presenting the item.

OK! Dont panic we got you covered!

The pack includes over 50  fully textured, low poly models of items usually used in all sorts of jump&run games, endless runners, platformers and all types of games which have something to be collected from the player. The textures are in png format 512x512 which is pretty high for such an item and the best way to use it is to combine several textures in one texture atlas (that is why we have almost every asset in his own texture, similar assets share one texture like for example the strawberry and the apple).

Every item have cutout prerendered .png file (some have more of one, covering different angles!) to be used in the GUI of the game.

Good Luck!
